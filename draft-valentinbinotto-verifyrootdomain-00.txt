A method to declare domain names that are not a subdomain of the primary
                         domain as trustworthy
               draft-valentinbinotto-verifyrootdomain-00

Abstract

   This document describes a method by which the owners/administrators
   of a specific domain name can declare other domain names, which are
   not subdomains of the primary domain but are used by the owners/
   administrators of the primary domain, as trusted by using TXT records
   in the DNS zone of the primary domain.

1.  Introduction

   Internet infrastructure providers sometimes use different domain
   names that are not hierarchically related.  This can make it unclear
   whether a domain name can be trusted because the infrastructure
   provider simply uses a second domain name for a part of his
   infrastructure or network, or if it is a maliciously registered
   domain name that aims to pretend legitimacy.  When using subdomains,
   this problem does not arise because with a trusted parent domain
   name, it can be assumed that the corresponding subdomain is also
   legitimate and trustworthy.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  The Specification

   A TXT record ([RFC1035]) MUST be created in the authoritative DNS
   zone under the subdomain "vroot" below the primary domain of an
   infrastructure provider.  In this entry, in addition to the
   corresponding entries in the WHOIS database ([RFC1834]), the first
   name and last name of the root domain owner MUST be recorded in such
   a TXT record.  Both the first name and last name are written in
   lowercase and separated by a period.

   vroot.valentin-43-44.org.    IN   TXT   "valentin.binotto"

   In another TXT record, under the subdomain "vroot", MAY can be
   defined which other domain names are also used by the infrastructure
   provider.  This enumeration does not include subdomains of the
   primary domain.  The listed domain names SHOULD be defined as close

   to the domain-root as possible, which means that, for example,
   individual subdomains of "example.com" SHOULD NOT be listed if the
   security and trustworthiness of "example.com" itself and all its
   subdomains below can be guaranteed.

   vroot.example.net.    IN   TXT   "example.com:example.org"

3.  Security Considerations

   According to the author, no security considerations apply to this
   document.

4.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.
