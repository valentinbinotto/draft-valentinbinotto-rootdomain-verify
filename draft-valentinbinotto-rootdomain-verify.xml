    <abstract>
	    <t>This document describes a method by which the owners/administrators of a specific domain name can declare other domain names, which are not subdomains of the primary domain but are used by the owners/administrators of the primary domain, as trusted by using TXT records in the DNS zone of the primary domain.</t>

    <section anchor="introduction" title="Introduction">
	    <t>Internet infrastructure providers sometimes use different domain names that are not hierarchically related. This can make it unclear whether a domain name can be trusted because the infrastructure provider simply uses a second domain name for a part of his infrastructure or network, or if it is a maliciously registered domain name that aims to pretend legitimacy. When using subdomains, this problem does not arise because with a trusted parent domain name, it can be assumed that the corresponding subdomain is also legitimate and trustworthy.</t>

    <section anchor="the-specification" title="The Specification">
	    <t>A TXT record (<xref target="RFC1035" />) MUST be created in the authoritative DNS zone under the subdomain "vroot" below the primary domain of an infrastructure provider. In this entry, in addition to the corresponding entries in the WHOIS database, the first name and last name of the root domain owner MUST be recorded in such a TXT record.
Both the first name and last name are written in lowercase and separated by a period.
    <sourcecode type="txt" markers="false"><![CDATA[
        vroot.valentin-43-44.org.    IN   TXT   "valentin.binotto"
]]></sourcecode>
In another TXT record, under the subdomain "vroot", MAY can be defined which other domain names are also used by the infrastructure provider. This enumeration does not include subdomains of the primary domain. The listed domain names SHOULD be defined as close to the domain-root as possible, which means that, for example, individual subdomains of "example.com" SHOULD NOT be listed if the security and trustworthiness of "example.com" itself and all its subdomains below can be guaranteed.</t>
