    <abstract>
	    <t>This document describes a method by which the owners/administrators of a specific domain name can declare other domain names, which are not subdomains of the primary domain but are used by the owners/administrators of the primary domain, as trusted by using TXT records in the DNS zone of the primary domain.</t>

    <section anchor="introduction" title="Introduction">
	    <t>Internet infrastructure providers sometimes use different domain names that are not hierarchically related. This can make it unclear whether a domain name can be trusted because the infrastructure provider simply uses a second domain name for a part of his infrastructure or network, or if it is a maliciously registered domain name that aims to pretend legitimacy. When using subdomains, this problem does not arise because with a trusted parent domain name, it can be assumed that the corresponding subdomain is also legitimate and trustworthy.</t>

	    <t>A subset of the BGP communities of ASN 65535, the last ASN of the 16 bit range, are reserved for use by Well-known communities as described in <xref target="RFC1997" /> and <xref target="IANA.WK" />.  Although this is not currently true of ASN 4294967295, if there is a future need for another Special Use ASN that is not designed to be globally routable, or the associated BGP communities of such an ASN, ASN 4294967295 could be a valid candidate for such purpose.  This document does not prescribe any such Special Use to this ASN at the time of publication.</t>
